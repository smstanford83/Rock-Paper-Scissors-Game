## Scott's Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a fun beginner project as I start to learn Python.

# Instructions
Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

# Process
From there, I had to figure out: 

* How will I store the user's input.
* * As a bonus, I've included input validation so the game doesn't break if the user enters an invalid value.

* How will I generate a random choice for the computer.

* How will I compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).

* And also how will I give feedback to the player. 

You can find the "official" rules of the game on [the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/)
